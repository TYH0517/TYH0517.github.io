I am interested in understanding the regularities of brain activity in humans that underlie adaptive cognition and behavior. There are two parts to my current research: the first is to examine how self-related and non-self-related processes differ dynamically in the brain and how such differences affect cognitive functions and behaviors; the second is to examine the temporal process and its neural activities. The temporal information contained in the brain is critical for determining time to action. In addition to exploring the basic functions of these large-scale dynamic neural systems, I am also interested in how they are affected in the patient population, in particular in patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders.

My research group combines non-invasive brain imaging techniques (EEG/MEG, MRI, brain stimulation) with behavioural methods (eye tracking, computer-based tasks) to study the human brain. We design tasks with fine-grained modulation in cognitive processes and behavioral responses as a means of investigating the effects of this modulation on psychological and brain processing in support of adaptive behavior within dynamic environments. Rhythmic brain activity is of particular interest. In turn, this can help us gain a better understanding of how time-evolving neuronal signals are processed and integrated to control our experiences and actions in the present and in the future.
