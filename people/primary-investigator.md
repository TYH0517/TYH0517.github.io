I am interested in the connections between brain and cognitive functions. I studied visual attention, visual short-term memory, and executive functions with various neuroimaging tools, including EEG/MEG, MRI, TMS, tDCS, and eyetracker, to address different research questions. Recently, I am interested in brain activity and self-related processes. How our brains generate self-related and non-self related processes and how this relationship affects cognitive functions is my main focus. I also work with clinical doctors to understand the neural correlated of self-related proceess on psychiatric patients. If you are interested in my projects, please check projects page.
