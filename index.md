We are interested in understanding the regularities of brain activity that underlie adaptive cognition and behaviours. Our laboratory uses state-of-the-art noninvasive brain imaging techniques, including EEG/MEG, brain stimulation, and MRI, in order to explore the neural basis for a variety of cognitive functions, such as attention, short-term/working memory, self-related process, inhibitory control, decision making, and metacognition. Additionally, we collaborate with clinical doctors to examine how these basic functions in large-scale dynamic neural systems are affected by patients with mental and neurological disorders. 

Our laboratory is friendly and supportive. LGBTQ individuals, as well as individuals of different ethnicities, are welcome in our laboratory. Diversity serves as a foundation for fostering motivation and creativity at our lab. We also promote eco-friendly practices. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you are interested in our laboratory.
