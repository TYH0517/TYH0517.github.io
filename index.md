We are interested in understanding the regularities of brain activity that underlie adaptive cognition and behaviours. Our laboratory uses state-of-the-art noninvasive brain imaging techniques, including EEG/MEG, brain stimulation, and MRI, in order to explore the neural basis for a variety of cognitive functions. Additionally, we collaborate with clinical doctors to examine how patients with mental and neurological disorders affect these basic functions in large-scale dynamic neural systems. 

Our laboratory is friendly and supportive. LGBTQ individuals, as well as individuals of different ethnicities, are welcome in our laboratory. Diversity serves as a foundation for fostering motivation and creativity at our lab. We also promote eco-friendly practices. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you are interested in our laboratory.
